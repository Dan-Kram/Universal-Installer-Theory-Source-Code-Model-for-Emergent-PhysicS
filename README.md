## Overview

The **Universal Installer** is a theoretical framework in which the universe is modeled as a **self-executing source code**, where fundamental constants, spacetime, matter, and information emerge from a computational process.

This repository documents the development of the theory, including:

- Core equations
- Pseudocode representing universe evolution
- Research diary entries
- Potential applications
- Simulation placeholders
- References and citations

The main goal is to **provide a timestamped public record** of this original idea.

## Core Idea

Imagine the universe as a program installed in a singularity (black hole), unfolding spontaneously:

- `INIT` = Big Bang / initial conditions  
- `EVOLVE` = Spontaneous unfolding guided by entropy and information  
- `ùìò(t)` = Information content ("installer code") guiding the emergence of physical laws  
- Fundamental constants (G, c, ‚Ñè, Œõ) are **dynamic and emergent**  
- Black Hole ‚Äì White Hole duality: forward evolution = expansion, backward evolution = contraction  

Time itself is an **emergent property**, directly linked to the rate of entropy and information generation.

## Universal Installer Equation

The compact form of the theory:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \mathbf{X}(t) = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{X}(t))
$$

Where:
X = (G, c, ‚Ñè, Œõ, œÜ, œÜÃá, œÅ, S, ùìò, g_{ŒºŒΩ})

- `F` encodes interactions among variables  
- `g_{ŒºŒΩ}` evolves via a generalization of Einstein‚Äôs field equations  
- Constants evolve according to a relaxation process driven by `ùìò(t)`  
- Entropy S drives the emergent ‚Äúflow of time‚Äù

## Pseudocode Representation

```c
INIT {
    S = 0; I = I0; c = 1; h = Œµ; G = Œ¥; Œõ = Œª0;
    phi = phi0; phidot = phidot0; rho = rho0;
}

EVOLVE {
    while (is_stable(X)) {
        ŒîS = stochastic_fluctuation_term(X);
        S += max(ŒîS, 0);
        I = update_information(I, S);
        geometry = f_G(S, I, G, Œõ, rho);
        quanta = f_Q(S, I, h, phi, phidot);
        light = f_c(S, I, c);
        (phi, phidot) = evolve_scalar(phi, phidot, geometry);
        rho = evolve_energy(rho, geometry, quanta, Œõ);
        (G, c, h, Œõ) = stabilize_constants(G, c, h, Œõ, S, I);
        if (!is_stable(X)) gravitational_collapse(X);
    }
